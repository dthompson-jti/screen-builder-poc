# Screen Studio - Form Editor Proof of Concept

Screen Studio is a high-craft, modern tool for building complex, data-driven user interface screens. This repository contains the proof-of-concept application, demonstrating a robust architecture for a drag-and-drop canvas, a sophisticated data navigation system, and a highly polished user experience.
