Of course. Based on your excellent feedback, here is a pragmatic refactoring and hardening plan that respects your preferences for a flatter structure and focuses on "progress over perfection."

# Project Refactoring & Hardening Plan

This document outlines an actionable plan to improve the project's structure, maintainability, and robustness. The goal is to introduce clear organizational patterns without requiring a complete rewrite, focusing on incremental improvements that will pay dividends as the application grows.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Colocation:** Group files related to a major feature together to improve context and discoverability.
*   **Clarity over Complexity:** Prefer a flatter, more direct folder structure.
*   **Incremental Progress:** Prioritize changes that offer the most value with the least disruption.

## Phase 1: Project Structure & Component Colocation

The current flat structure is becoming difficult to navigate. We will introduce a top-level `features/` directory to house major application areas, while keeping truly generic components in `components/` and all data/state logic in `data/`.

### Proposed Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/          // Generic, reusable components (Modal, SearchInput, etc.)
│
├── data/                // REMAINS AS-IS: State, hooks, mock data, navigator.js
│
├── features/            // NEW: Major application areas
│   ├── EditorCanvas/
│   │   ├── EditorCanvas.tsx
│   │   ├── EditorCanvas.module.css
│   │   ├── FloatingSelectionToolbar.tsx  // Extracted component
│   │   ├── FormItem.tsx                  // Extracted component
│   │   ├── LayoutContainer.tsx           // Extracted component
│   │   └── SortableItem.tsx              // Extracted component
│   │
│   ├── PropertiesPanel/
│   │   ├── PropertiesPanel.tsx
│   │   └── PropertiesPanel.module.css
│   │
│   ├── Settings/
│   │   ├── SettingsPage.tsx
│   │   ├── SettingsPage.module.css
│   │   ├── SettingsForm.tsx
│   │   └── SettingsNavigator.tsx
│   │
│   └── ... (other major features like DataNavigatorView could move here later)
│
└── ... (App.tsx, index.css, etc.)
```

### Task List:

**1.1: Deconstruct `EditorCanvas.tsx`**
This is the highest-priority structural change. It will make the core canvas logic much easier to manage.
*   **Action:** Extract the following inner components from `src/views/EditorCanvas.tsx` into their own files within the new `src/features/EditorCanvas/` folder:
    *   `FloatingSelectionToolbar` -> `src/features/EditorCanvas/FloatingSelectionToolbar.tsx`
    *   `CanvasNode` (can be kept inside `EditorCanvas.tsx` as it's a small recursive helper)
    *   `SortableItem` -> `src/features/EditorCanvas/SortableItem.tsx`
    *   `DropPlaceholder` (can be kept inside `EditorCanvas.tsx`)
    *   `LayoutContainer` -> `src/features/EditorCanvas/LayoutContainer.tsx`
    *   `FormItem` -> `src/features/EditorCanvas/FormItem.tsx`
*   **Action:** Move `src/views/EditorCanvas.tsx` to `src/features/EditorCanvas/EditorCanvas.tsx`.
*   **Action:** Move `src/views/EditorCanvas.module.css` to `src/features/EditorCanvas/EditorCanvas.module.css`.
*   **Follow-up:** Update all import paths in the newly created files.

**1.2: Colocate the `PropertiesPanel` Feature**
The Properties Panel is a major, self-contained feature.
*   **Action:** Create a `src/features/PropertiesPanel/` directory.
*   **Action:** Move `src/views/PropertiesPanel.tsx` to `src/features/PropertiesPanel/PropertiesPanel.tsx`.
*   **Action:** Move `src/views/PropertiesPanel.module.css` to `src/features/PropertiesPanel/PropertiesPanel.module.css`.

**1.3: Colocate the `Settings` Feature**
The settings view is another distinct application area.
*   **Action:** Create a `src/features/Settings/` directory.
*   **Action:** Move the following files into the new directory:
    *   `src/views/SettingsPage.tsx`
    *   `src/views/SettingsPage.module.css`
    *   `src/views/SettingsForm.tsx`
    *   `src/views/SettingsNavigator.tsx`

**1.4: Rationalize the `components/` Folder**
Move any remaining view-specific components into their feature folders and reserve `src/components/` for truly generic, application-agnostic components.
*   **Action:** Review the `src/components/` directory. Components like `SelectionToolbar` could arguably be moved into `src/features/EditorCanvas/`, as they are tightly coupled to that feature. Components like `Modal`, `SearchInput`, and `ResizablePanel` should remain.

## Phase 2: Logic & Code Organization

These changes will improve code clarity and isolate complex logic.

### Task List:

**2.1: Create `useUrlSync` Custom Hook**
The logic for managing URL query parameters is currently in `App.tsx` and can be extracted for better separation of concerns.
*   **Action:** Create a new file `src/data/useUrlSync.ts`.
*   **Action:** Move the two `useEffect` hooks responsible for reading from and writing to `window.location.search` from `App.tsx` into this new custom hook.
*   **`App.tsx` Before:**
    ```tsx
    // ...
    useEffect(() => {
      // Logic to read from URL on initial load...
    }, []); 
    
    useEffect(() => {
      // Logic to write state changes to URL...
    }, [viewMode, isFluid, pWidth]);
    // ...
    ```
*   **`App.tsx` After:**
    ```tsx
    import { useUrlSync } from './data/useUrlSync';
    
    function App() {
      // ... state atoms ...
      useUrlSync(viewMode, isFluid, pWidth); // Clean, single line of code
      // ...
    }
    ```

**2.2: Harden TypeScript Usage**
Perform a pass on the codebase to tighten type safety.
*   **Action:** Search for any usage of `any` and replace it with a more specific type where possible.
*   **Action:** Ensure all event handlers are correctly typed (e.g., `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`, `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>`).
*   **Action:** Add explicit return types to functions, especially in utility and hook files. This improves readability and catches potential errors.

---

## Phase 3: Styling & Consistency

The styling system is strong. These tasks will ensure it remains robust and consistent.

### Task List:

**3.1: Audit Global Styles (`buttons.css`, `forms.css`)**
Confirm that global style files strictly adhere to their intended purpose.
*   **Action:** Review `buttons.css` and `forms.css`.
*   **Principle:** These files should define **appearance** (color, border, padding, font-size) but **NOT** layout (`margin`, `position`, `top`, `left`). Layout should always be handled by the parent component's CSS module or a flex/grid container.
*   **Outcome:** A set of highly predictable, composable base components.

**3.2: Standardize Scrollbar Implementation**
The `scrollbar-stealth` utility is a good solution. Ensure it's used consistently.
*   **Action:** Identify all scrollable containers in the application (e.g., `PropertiesPanel.module.css > .panelContent`, `EditorCanvas.module.css > .canvasContainer`).
*   **Action:** For each container, decide if the scrollbar should take up space or be an overlay. Apply the `scrollbar-stealth` and `scrollbar-stealth-content` classes where the overlay style is desired, following the pattern in `DataNavigatorView.tsx`.
*   **Outcome:** Consistent scrollbar behavior across the entire application.

4.  [ ] **Colocate `PropertiesPanel`:** Move its files into the new feature folder.
5.  [ ] **Colocate `Settings`:** Move its files into the new feature folder.
6.  [ ] **Audit & Refine:** Perform the TypeScript and global styling consistency checks.
7.  [ ] **Standardize Scrollbars:** Apply the `scrollbar-stealth` utility where needed.
