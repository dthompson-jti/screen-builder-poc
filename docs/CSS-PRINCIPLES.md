# High-Craft CSS Principles

This document codifies the core principles and patterns for writing CSS in the Screen Studio project. Adhering to these guidelines is essential for maintaining a consistent, robust, and high-craft user interface.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Master the Box Model, Especially Positioning

The CSS Box Model is not optional knowledge. Before using `position: absolute` or `position: fixed`, you must be able to answer:

-   **What is its "positioned ancestor"?** If none exists, it will be the viewport.
-   **How will it get its width and height?** Have I provided explicit dimensions (`width`, `height`) or constraints (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`)?
-   Never assume an element will "just know" its size. You must declare it.

#### 2. Diagnose, Don't Guess

When debugging a UI issue, follow this simple diagnostic process to find the root cause instead of guessing at solutions:

1.  **Isolate:** Use the browser inspector to find the exact element that is failing.
2.  **Inspect:** Analyze its "Computed" styles. Don't just look at the CSS you wrote; look at what the browser *actually rendered*. A `width: 0px` or unexpected `margin` is the key clue.
3.  **Hypothesize:** Form a hypothesis based on CSS fundamentals. "My hypothesis is the element has no width because it's absolutely positioned without horizontal constraints."
4.  **Test:** Use the browser's style editor to test your hypothesis in real-time (e.g., add `left: 0; right: 0;`). If it works, you've found the solution.

#### 3. Trust, but Verify the Final DOM

React components, UI libraries (Radix), and animation libraries (Framer Motion) can all add wrapper `divs` or change the final DOM structure. Your React code is not the final source of truthâ€”the browser's "Elements" panel is. Always debug the final rendered HTML, not the JSX you assume is being rendered.

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### The "Safe Zone" Padding Contract for Focus Rings

To ensure visual consistency and prevent UI bugs, we have standardized on a **`2px` outer focus ring** for all interactive components.

-   **Problem:** Parent containers with `overflow: hidden` (like accordions) will clip this outer focus ring, making it invisible and creating an accessibility issue.
-   **Solution (The Contract):** Any container component that must use `overflow: hidden` **must also provide an internal "safe zone" of padding** to accommodate the focus rings of its children.
-   **Implementation:** The standard safe zone is a `2px` padding (`var(--spacing-0p5)`). For example, our `Accordion` component's content area has this padding, guaranteeing that any form input placed inside can display its full `2px` outer focus ring without being clipped.

**The Exception: Menu Items**
Menu items (`.menu-item`) are the one justified exception to the outer focus ring rule. Because they are flush with the edges of a rounded-corner popover, an outer shadow would be clipped. Therefore, menu items use a robust **`inset 0 0 0 2px var(...)` box-shadow** for their keyboard focus state (`[data-highlighted]:focus-visible`).

#### The Shared Menu System (`menu.css`)

To enforce the "Single Source of Truth" principle for our UI, we use a shared, global stylesheet for all list-based selection components. This system guarantees that primitives from multiple Radix UI packages (`DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, `Select`) and custom components (like the **Data Navigator's item list in both the main panel and the data binding modal**) are visually indistinguishable.

It is built on two key patterns:

1.  **Shared Container (`.menu-popover`):** All menu popovers use this class, which defines the container's shape, shadow, padding, and a **`gap: 2px`** to create consistent spacing between items.
2.  **Shared Item (`.menu-item`):** All list items use this class. It defines a consistent height, internal padding, and a `1px solid transparent` border in its resting state. On hover or highlight, only the `background-color` and `border-color` are changed, preventing any layout shift. This creates a light, modern interaction style.

By composing these two classes, we achieve a perfectly consistent and robust menu system across the entire application.

#### The Icon Badging Pattern for Visual Status

To add secondary information to an icon without cluttering the UI, we use a CSS-only "badging" pattern.

-   **Problem:** A component or data field (e.g., a "transient" field) has a special status that needs to be communicated visually at a glance.
-   **Solution:** A wrapper `div` with `position: relative` is placed around the base icon. A second, smaller "badge" icon (e.g., the "T" for transient) is then absolutely positioned at the top-right corner of the wrapper.
-   **Implementation:** The badge icon is given a smaller `font-size` and a matching `opsz` (optical size) for clarity, and a `text-shadow` can be used to lift it visually from the base icon. This creates a clean, scalable, and high-craft way to badge icons with status indicators.
