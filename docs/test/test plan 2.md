Of course. Here is the updated UXR test plan, revised based on your audio recording and notes about the project's recent overhaul.

### **Test Plan: Screen Studio POC v2**

#### **1. Goals & Objectives**
This test aims to evaluate the core data-driven workflow, new interaction models, and UI clarity of the updated Screen Studio proof of concept. We want to understand if the primary path for building a form is intuitive and efficient, and how users respond to new features designed to improve usability.

**Primary Learning Goals:**

*   **Core Workflow Validation:** Can users efficiently complete the fundamental form-building loop: finding data, adding fields, configuring, and organizing them?
*   **New Interaction Model Evaluation:** How do users discover and utilize new features like right-click context menus, direct on-canvas text editing, and multi-selection?
*   **UI/UX Discoverability & Preference:** Are key features like settings and panel controls easily discoverable? What are users' preferences on key UI variations (e.g., compact menu, settings layout, destructive colors)?
*   **Overall Impression:** Does the tool feel logical and empower users to build forms confidently?

#### **2. Target Participants**
*   **Profile:** Business Analysts, Implementation Specialists, or Product Managers responsible for designing or configuring forms in enterprise software. They are technically proficient but not necessarily developers.
*   **Number of Participants:** 2-3

---

#### **3. Methodology**
*   **Method:** Remote, Moderated 1-on-1 Sessions
*   **Duration:** 30-45 minutes per session
*   **Tools:** Video conferencing software, a link to the interactive POC.

#### **4. Moderator's Introduction Script**
"Hi [Participant Name], thank you so much for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and I'll be guiding you through this session.

Today, we'll be looking at an early prototype for a new tool called Screen Studio, which is designed to help people build data-entry screens. Because this is an early concept, some things might not be fully functional, and that's perfectly okay.

The most important thing to know is that we're testing the prototype, not you. There are no right or wrong answers, and you absolutely cannot do anything wrong. Your honest feedback is the most valuable thing you can give us, as it will help us make the product better.

To help us understand your thought process, I'm going to ask you to think aloud as much as possible. Please tell me what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you expect to happen. It might feel a bit strange at first, but it's incredibly helpful for us.

Finally, please know that this session will be recorded. Do you have any questions before we get started?"

#### **5. Scenario: Core Form-Building Workflow**
**Introduction:** "Imagine you're building a screen for police officers to file an arrest report. We'll start by adding and configuring the key fields. Please remember to think aloud as you go."

**Task 1: Add & Edit a Field**
*   "First, please add the `Arrest Date` field to the main screen area."
*   "Now, can you change the label for that field directly on the screen from 'Arrest Date' to 'Date of Arrest'?"
*   *(Observe: Do they double-click, right-click, or look for an option in a toolbar or properties panel?)*

**Task 2: Multi-Select & Configure**
*   "Next, please add the `Arresting Agency File Number` and the `Case Number` to the screen."
*   "Now, select both the `Arresting Agency File Number` and `Case Number` fields on the screen at the same time."
*   "With both fields selected, please mark them as required."
*   "Great. Now, could you try selecting those same two fields using the list in the left-hand panel?"
*   *(Observe: Do they intuitively use Shift-click or Ctrl/Cmd-click? Do they discover how to perform an action on a multi-selection?)*

**Task 3: Re-order & Convert with Context Menu**
*   "Please move the `Arresting Agency File Number` so it appears above the `Date of Arrest`."
*   *(Observe: Do they use drag-and-drop or discover the right-click context menu to move the item?)*
*   "Next, add a 'Section Heading' from the component list to the top of the form and name it 'Incident Details'."
*   "Actually, that shouldn't be a heading. Can you change 'Incident Details' into a regular paragraph of text?"
*   *(Observe: Do they discover the 'convert' action in the right-click menu?)*

**Task 4: Delete & Undo**
*   "We've decided not to include the `Case Number` field after all. Please remove it from the screen."
*   "Actually, that was a mistake. Can you bring that field back using a single action?"
*   *(Observe: Do they use a toolbar button, the delete key, or the right-click menu? Do they use the Undo button or a keyboard shortcut?)*

**Task 5: Panel Management**
*   "Sometimes you need more screen space. Please close the panel on the left and the panel on the right."
*   "Now, please bring them back."
*   *(Observe: How do they close the panels? How easily do they discover the controls to restore them?)*

**Task 6: Navigate, Search & Add**
*   "Now you need to add information about the charges related to the victim. Find the Victim Status and add a field from there."
*   *(Observe: Do they use the navigator to go from 'Arrest' to 'Victim' and then to 'Arrest Charges'? Is the navigator's concept clear?)*
*   "You know there's a 'Status Date' field back in the main Arrest data. Please go back, search for it, and add it to the form."
*   *(Observe: Do they navigate back easily? Do they discover and use the search bar effectively?)*

**Task 7: Rename the Form**
*   "The title of this form is currently 'My screen'. Please change it to 'Arrest Form'."
*   *(Observe: Do they find the edit icon next to the name? Is the editing experience intuitive?)*

#### **6. UI Preference Questions**
**Introduction:** "Great, that completes the main tasks. Now I'd like to get your quick opinion on a few different design variations for the interface."

*   **UI Preference 1: Left Menu Layout**
    *   "Here are two ways the left-hand menu could look. Do you have a preference for the **standard or compact version**? Why?"
*   **UI Preference 2: Settings Layout**
    *   "Which of these two versions of the settings page do you prefer: the **single column or two-column layout**? Why?"
*   **UI Preference 3: Delete Action Color**
    *   "When you delete an item, should the confirmation button use a standard color or a **red 'destructive' color** to indicate danger? Why?"

---

#### **7. Post-Test Debrief & Wrap-up**
*   **Overall Impression:** "Thank you. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy, how would you rate the overall experience of building a form with this tool?"
*   **Clarity Probe:** "Did you notice any color-coding or icons that particularly helped or confused you during the tasks?"
*   **Expectations:** "Was there anything you expected to be able to do that you couldn't?"
*   **Final Thoughts:** "If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this prototype, what would it be?"

"This has been incredibly helpful. Your feedback will directly influence how we develop this tool. Thank you again for your time and valuable insights!"
