# Screen Studio: Project Overview & Conventions

This document is the primary entry point for developers. It provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture, file structure, and coding conventions.

## 1. Core Architectural Principles

These foundational rules ensure a consistent, high-craft, and maintainable user experience.

-   **Single Source of Truth:** Every piece of data and every visual element must have one, and only one, unambiguous source of truth. State is managed centrally (Jotai), styling is encapsulated within components, and content is separated from presentation.
-   **Intrinsic Sizing and Natural Flow:** Components and layouts are intrinsically sized by default. We avoid fixed heights in favor of `min-height` and modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) to allow content to flow naturally. The canvas feels like a fluid, living document.
-   **State-Driven Appearance:** The UI reflects the application's state by changing the appearance of existing elements (via `data-*` attributes), not by swapping out chunks of the DOM. This ensures UI stability and eliminates jarring visual jumps.
-   **High-Craft Transitions:** All state changes are communicated through smooth, purposeful transitions on performant CSS properties (`transform`, `opacity`, etc.).

## 2. Directory Structure & Import Guidelines

This project uses a **feature-based architecture**. The goal is to group files by their application feature (e.g., `Editor`, `Settings`) to improve colocation and maintainability.

-   **/src**: Contains the application entry point (`main.tsx`), root container (`App.tsx`), global utility stylesheets, and global type definitions.
-   **/src/features**: Contains the major, user-facing areas of the application. Each sub-directory is a "vertical slice" of functionality.
-   **/src/components**: Contains only **truly generic and reusable** UI primitives that are application-agnostic.
-   **/src/data**: A consolidated directory for all non-visual logic and definitions (Jotai atoms, custom hooks, etc.).

**Import Rule:** Always use relative paths (`./`, `../`). This project does not use TypeScript path aliases.

## 3. State Management Architecture

The project uses **Jotai** for its minimal, atomic state management model. State is divided into two tiers:

1.  **UI State (`src/data/atoms.ts`):** Manages the "control panel" of the UIâ€”panel visibility, active tabs, modal states, and the current interaction mode of the canvas (idle, selecting, editing).
2.  **Core Application State (`src/data/historyAtoms.ts`):** The most critical state file. It manages the actual structure of the form being built and implements the entire undo/redo system using a **reducer pattern**.

### The Golden Rule: `commitActionAtom`

To modify the canvas state, you **must** use the `commitActionAtom`. This is a write-only atom that acts as the central dispatcher for all mutations, ensuring every change is predictable, testable, and automatically recorded in the undo/redo history.

## 4. Canvas & Interaction Architecture

The canvas is built on a contract of stability, clarity, and intuitive interaction.

### The Interactive Layer Pattern
To ensure separation of concerns, the canvas renders components through a stack of wrappers. Logic is strictly isolated:
-   **`ComponentRenderer`**: A pure, memoizable component responsible only for visual presentation.
-   **`SelectionWrapper`**: A higher-order component that implements the core canvas interaction logic, including the advanced selection model and display of the `SelectionToolbar`.
-   **`SortableWrapper`**: The outermost layer that integrates with `dnd-kit` to provide drag-and-drop capabilities.

### Advanced Selection Model
The editor uses an industry-standard selection model to feel familiar and powerful.
-   **Single Click:** Selects a single component. This also sets a "selection anchor" for range-selects.
-   **Ctrl/Cmd + Click:** Toggles a single component into or out of the current selection without deselecting others.
-   **Shift + Click:** Selects a contiguous range of components from the last "selection anchor". This is based on the component order in the data tree, not visual position, ensuring predictable behavior. This is constrained to components that share the same parent container.

### Action Discoverability ("Smart Toolbar" & Context Menu)
-   **Multiple Access Points:** Actions can be triggered via the `SelectionToolbar`, the right-click `CanvasContextMenu`, and keyboard hotkeys.
-   **Single Source of Truth for Logic:** A centralized hook, `useComponentCapabilities`, determines which actions are possible in any given context. This ensures consistency across all UI surfaces.
-   **Discoverable & Disabled:** Both the `SelectionToolbar`'s `[...]` menu and the `CanvasContextMenu` serve as a complete index of all possible actions. Actions that cannot be performed are shown but are disabled, teaching the user the full capability of the tool.
-   **Contextual Shortcuts:** The top-level toolbar provides shortcuts to the most common actions, and includes a "smart" slot that shows a contextual action like **Wrap** or **Unwrap**.

### Drag-and-Drop (DnD) Contracts
-   **Stability Above All:** Layout-shifting animations are disabled during a drag operation to keep drop targets "rock solid".
-   **Centralized Logic:** All DnD event handling (`onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragEnd`) is encapsulated within the `src/data/useCanvasDnd.ts` hook.

## 5. Styling Architecture

The project uses a **systematic CSS architecture** organized into layers to control specificity and promote a cohesive design language.

-   **Design Tokens:** The styling foundation is a two-tiered token system:
    -   `primitives.css`: Contains raw, context-agnostic values like hex codes and spacing units.
    -   `semantics.css`: Maps primitive values to semantic, purpose-driven variable names (e.g., `--control-bg-hover`).
-   **Data-Attribute Styling:** Components use `data-*` attributes for styling variants (e.g., `<Button data-variant="tertiary" data-size="s">`). This provides superior semantic clarity and simplifies style composition over traditional modifier classes.
-   **Layered Cascade:** The global style cascade is managed in a single location (`src/index.css`) using CSS `@layer`. This provides predictable style application and prevents specificity conflicts between global styles, shared component styles, and scoped CSS Modules.
-   **Robust Primitives:** Core UI patterns that require complex state management and accessibility (dropdowns, context menus, tooltips) are built using **Radix UI**, enhancing stability and craft.

## 6. Key File Manifest

    *   `CanvasRenderers.tsx`: Pure presentation logic (The View).
