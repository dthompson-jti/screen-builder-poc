# Screen Studio: Project Overview & Conventions

This document is the primary entry point for developers. It provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture, file structure, and coding conventions.

## 1. Core Architectural Principles

These foundational rules ensure a consistent, high-craft, and maintainable user experience.

-   **Single Source of Truth:** Every piece of data and every visual element must have one, and only one, unambiguous source of truth. State is managed centrally (Jotai), styling is encapsulated within components, and content is separated from presentation.
-   **Intrinsic Sizing and Natural Flow:** Components and layouts are intrinsically sized by default. We avoid fixed heights in favor of `min-height` and modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) to allow content to flow naturally. The canvas feels like a fluid, living document.
-   **State-Driven Appearance:** The UI reflects the application's state by changing the appearance of existing elements (via modifier classes or `data-attributes`), not by swapping out chunks of the DOM. This ensures UI stability and eliminates jarring visual jumps.
-   **High-Craft Transitions:** All state changes are communicated through smooth, purposeful transitions on performant CSS properties (`transform`, `opacity`, etc.).

## 2. Directory Structure & Import Guidelines

This project uses a **feature-based architecture**. The goal is to group files by their application feature (e.g., `Editor`, `Settings`) to improve colocation and maintainability.

-   **/src**: Contains the application entry point (`main.tsx`), root container (`App.tsx`), global utility stylesheets, and global type definitions.
-   **/src/features**: Contains the major, user-facing areas of the application. Each sub-directory is a "vertical slice" of functionality.
-   **/src/components**: Contains only **truly generic and reusable** UI primitives that are application-agnostic.
-   **/src/data**: A consolidated directory for all non-visual logic and definitions (Jotai atoms, custom hooks, etc.).

**Import Rule:** Always use relative paths (`./`, `../`). This project does not use TypeScript path aliases.

## 3. State Management Architecture

The project uses **Jotai** for its minimal, atomic state management model. State is divided into two tiers:

1.  **UI State (`src/data/atoms.ts`):** Manages the "control panel" of the UIâ€”panel visibility, active tabs, modal states, and the current interaction mode of the canvas (idle, selecting, editing).
2.  **Core Application State (`src/data/historyAtoms.ts`):** The most critical state file. It manages the actual structure of the form being built and implements the entire undo/redo system using a **reducer pattern**.

### The Golden Rule: `commitActionAtom`

To modify the canvas state, you **must** use the `commitActionAtom`. This is a write-only atom that acts as the central dispatcher for all mutations, ensuring every change is predictable, testable, and automatically recorded in the undo/redo history.

## 4. Canvas & Interaction Architecture

The canvas is built on a contract of stability, clarity, and intuitive interaction.

### The Interactive Layer Pattern
To ensure separation of concerns, the canvas renders components through a stack of wrappers. Logic is strictly isolated:
-   **`ComponentRenderer`**: A pure, memoizable component responsible only for visual presentation.
-   **`SelectionWrapper`**: A higher-order component that implements the core canvas interaction logic, including the advanced selection model and display of the `SelectionToolbar`.
-   **`SortableWrapper`**: The outermost layer that integrates with `dnd-kit` to provide drag-and-drop capabilities.

### Advanced Selection Model
The editor uses an industry-standard selection model to feel familiar and powerful.
-   **Single Click:** Selects a single component. This also sets a "selection anchor" for range-selects.
-   **Ctrl/Cmd + Click:** Toggles a single component into or out of the current selection without deselecting others.
-   **Shift + Click:** Selects a contiguous range of components from the last "selection anchor". This is based on the component order in the data tree, not visual position, ensuring predictable behavior. This is constrained to components that share the same parent container.

### Action Discoverability ("Smart Toolbar")
-   **Single Source of Truth:** The `[...]` menu on the `SelectionToolbar` is the complete index of all actions possible for a component.
-   **Discoverable & Disabled:** Actions that cannot be performed in the current context are shown in the menu but are disabled, teaching the user the full capability of the tool.
-   **Contextual Shortcuts:** The top-level toolbar provides shortcuts to the most common actions, and includes a "smart" slot that shows a contextual action like **Wrap** or **Unwrap**.

### Drag-and-Drop (DnD) Contracts
-   **Stability Above All:** Layout-shifting animations are disabled during a drag operation to keep drop targets "rock solid".
-   **Centralized Logic:** All DnD event handling (`onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragEnd`) is encapsulated within the `src/data/useCanvasDnd.ts` hook.

## 5. Styling Architecture

The project uses a **hybrid CSS architecture** organized into layers to control specificity.
1.  **`base` Layer:** Global utility classes and design tokens.
2.  **`components` Layer:** Shared appearance styles using `data-attributes`.
3.  **Unlayered (CSS Modules):** The default for component-specific, scoped layout and styling.

## 6. Key File Manifest

### Core Application (`src/`)
*   **`main.tsx`**: The application's entry point.
*   **`App.tsx`**: The root React component and application shell.
*   **`types.ts`**: Centralized TypeScript type definitions.

### Data & State Management (`src/data/`)
*   **`atoms.ts`**: Defines all global **UI state** using Jotai atoms. Includes the core `canvasInteractionAtom` and the `selectionAnchorIdAtom` for range-select.
*   **`historyAtoms.ts`**: The heart of the application. Implements the undo/redo system and manages the core canvas state via a reducer pattern.
*   **`useCanvasDnd.ts`**: A custom hook encapsulating all drag-and-drop logic for the canvas.
*   **`useEditorHotkeys.ts`**: A custom hook that centralizes all global keyboard shortcut logic.
*   **`useUndoRedo.ts`**: A custom hook providing a clean API for undo/redo actions.

### Features (`src/features/`)
*   **`Editor/`**: The main form-building feature.
    *   `EditorCanvas.tsx`: The main container component.
    *   `CanvasNode.tsx`: The recursive engine for rendering the component tree.
    *   `CanvasRenderers.tsx`: Pure presentation logic (The View).
    *   `CanvasWrappers.tsx`: Manages all user interaction logic (selection, DnD, context menus).
    *   `PropertiesPanel/`: The right-hand panel for editing component properties.
*   **`ComponentBrowser/`**: The left-hand panel for adding new components.
*   **`AppHeader/`**: The main application header.
*   **`Preview/`**: The "Preview" mode for a clean, editor-free view of the form.

### Reusable Components (`src/components/`)
*   **`FormRenderer.tsx`**: A crucial, "pure" component that recursively renders the form state with no editor logic.
*   **`Modal.tsx`, `Select.tsx`, `Tooltip.tsx`, etc.**: High-quality, generic UI primitives.
