## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

### 1.1. Overview
The Screen Studio canvas is a highly interactive and custom-built interface. While visually intuitive, it currently lacks the necessary semantic structure and keyboard operability required for users who rely on assistive technologies (AT) like screen readers or who navigate exclusively via keyboard.

### 1.2. Problem
A user who cannot use a mouse is unable to perform fundamental tasks such as selecting, reordering, or deleting components on the canvas. A user with a visual impairment will hear a generic and unhelpful description of the canvas, with no way to understand its structure or the components within it. This effectively excludes these user groups from using the application.

## 2. Goals

-   **P1 (Must Have):** Achieve baseline compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for keyboard accessibility. All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via the keyboard.
-   **P1 (Must Have):** Provide a coherent screen reader experience for navigating the canvas component tree and understanding the state of selected components.
-   **P2 (Should Have):** Ensure all UI controls (buttons, inputs, etc.) have proper ARIA attributes and accessible labels.
-   **P3 (Nice to Have):** Implement advanced ARIA patterns for composite widgets like the canvas to announce relationships (e.g., "List of 5 items, item 2 of 5, 'First Name' text input, selected").

## 3. Non-Goals

-   Achieving full WCAG 2.1 Level AAA compliance.
-   Creating a fully custom screen reader experience that overrides default browser behavior. We will leverage standard HTML and ARIA patterns first.

## 4. User Stories / Requirements

### 4.1. Keyboard Navigation
-   **REQ-A11Y-01:** As a keyboard-only user, I want to be able to tab into the canvas area, at which point the currently selected component (or the first component if none are selected) receives focus.
-   **REQ-A11Y-02:** As a keyboard-only user, once focus is within the canvas, I want to be able to use the arrow keys (Up/Down) to move focus between sibling components in a container.
-   **REQ-A11Y-03:** As a keyboard-only user, I want to be able to use Enter or Spacebar to select the currently focused component.
-   **REQ-A11Y-04:** As a keyboard-only user, I want to be able to use standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+Click`, `Shift+Arrows`) to perform multi-selection, consistent with the advanced selection model.
-   **REQ-A11Y-05:** As a keyboard-only user, when a component is selected, I want to be able to press a key (e.g., `Tab`) to move focus to its `SelectionToolbar`.

### 4.2. Screen Reader Experience
-   **REQ-A11Y-06:** As a screen reader user, when I focus on a canvas component, I want it to announce its name, type, and selection state (e.g., "First Name, text input, selected").
-   **REQ-A11Y-07:** As a screen reader user, when I focus on a layout container, I want it to announce its name and the number of children it contains (e.g., "User Details, layout container, 3 items").
-   **REQ-A11Y-08:** As a screen reader user, I want all buttons in toolbars and panels to have clear, accessible labels that describe their function (e.g., "Wrap in container").

## 5. Success Metrics

-   A user can build a simple form (add 3 fields, wrap them in a container, delete one) using only the keyboard.
-   Using a screen reader (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac), navigating the canvas provides a logical and understandable audio output of the form's structure.
-   Automated accessibility audit tools (like Axe DevTools) report zero critical or serious violations on the main editor page.
